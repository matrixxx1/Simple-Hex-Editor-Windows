# Simple Hex Editor for Windows

Inspect file bytes with a clear hex and text view.

This is the initial Microsoft Store-oriented Windows desktop app scaffold for $(System.Collections.Hashtable.Title). It uses .NET 8 and WPF, keeps the first implementation local-first, and includes a repo-root Store-Assets folder for listing and privacy handoff material.

## Initial scope

- File byte inspection workflow
- Offset and hex preview concept
- Search surface
- Careful edit planning

## Build

``powershell
dotnet build .\SimpleHexEditor\SimpleHexEditor.csproj -c Release
``

## Store notes

Before final packaging, reserve the exact Microsoft Store product name in Partner Center and update package identity values to match that reservation.
